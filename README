libconfig 
-----------------------------------------------------
libconfig gives a C and C++ interface to writing and 
reading configuration files. 

libconfig installed in top level directory:
(make sure to replace the --prefix with the location of 
your source tree)

cd src
tar zxvf ../tars/libconfig-1.3.1.tgz
cd src/libconfig-1.3.1/
./configure --prefix=/home/hglawler/src/watcher ~/src/watcher
make && make install

This could have been part of the build process, but I decided
to just install it in the interest of simplicity. If you need to 
rebuild or update, do the sequence above...

libidsCommunications.a
----------------------------------------------------
libidsCommunications.a is pre-built in the ./lib
dir. If it needs to be rebuilt:

cd src/watcher/legacyWatcher
make libidsCommunications.a
cp libidsCommunications.a ../../../lib

liblog4cpp
----------------------------------------------------
Similar to libconfig. log4cpp is a c++ clone of the 
java logging package. Does all kinds of fancy logging.

It's been installed in the top level of the source
tree, but if you need to rebuild it:
(make sure to replace the --prefix with the location of 
your source tree)

cd src
tar zxvf ../tars/log4cpp-1.0.tar.gz
cd log4cpp-1.0
./configure --prefix=/home/glawler/src/watcher
make 
make install

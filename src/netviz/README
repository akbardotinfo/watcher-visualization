Steps to running netVis 

1. Run netServer.py on controller (this will dump out the controller
IP)

2. Modify line 47 of netClient.py: replace localhost with the IP
dumped in Step 1.

3. Run netServer.py on every virtual node (or test node if you not
using virtual machines)

4. Run guiClient.py on controller. At this point one can change views
between transfer and receive data and modify barchart scaling and
threshold settings.
